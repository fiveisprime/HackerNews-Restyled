## Installation

Hacker News Restyled is a Chrome Extension. It's available for install over at the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/npifkneibfmjhapdbgebjfcfdhdcidjh). Alternatively you can install direct from this GitHub:

1. [Download](https://github.com/nschaden/HackerNews-Restyled/zipball/master) this package's contents.
2. Drag the packaged/hackernews-restyled.crx file onto any open tab in Google Chrome.
3. Chrome will ask to verify that you want to install the hacker news restyled extension. Say yes.

The installation is then completed. Once you jump to most pages on Hacker News (news.ycombinator.com, news.ycombinator.net, news.ycombinator.org, hackerne.ws) the extension styling and extra javascript functionality should kick in.

Uninstall like any other extension: Under Chrome go to Window > Extensions and click on the 'Remove' button by Hacker News Restyled.
